## About
This is a Javafx application used to test other students' projects in my AP CS class in high school. You can give it a java file, and it will compile it and run different tests depending on the project.
### Supported Projects
- Programming Assignment 1: Election Simulator
- Programming Assignment 2: Prioritizing Patients
### Running

```
and compile the code into a runnable jar with
